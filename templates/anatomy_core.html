    <p>
        Bees, belonging to the order Hymenoptera and family Apidae, are small, winged insects that have captivated both
        scientists and nature enthusiasts for centuries. The most well-known species, the European honeybee (Apis
        mellifera), is a pinnacle of social organization. A honeybee colony operates as a superorganism, where
        individual roles contribute to the collective survival of the hive.

        Each bee—whether queen, worker, or drone—has a specialized role. The queen, larger than her colony mates, is the
        sole egg layer and the mother of the hive. Workers, sterile females, manage all tasks ranging from foraging for
        nectar and pollen, maintaining hive cleanliness, nursing larvae, and producing wax. Male drones exist solely to
        mate with queens from other colonies, their lives ending shortly after fulfilling this singular purpose.

        The anatomy of bees is uniquely suited to their ecological role. Their proboscis enables them to drink nectar,
        while their hind legs are equipped with "pollen baskets" for transporting pollen back to the hive. Compound eyes
        and sensitive antennae provide bees with the tools to detect colors, patterns, and even ultraviolet
        light—essential for locating flowers. Additionally, their waggle dance, a remarkable form of communication,
        enables foragers to convey the precise location of food sources to their hive mates.
